# What is One Task?

It is a web app that shows only one task in large font set by the user. This creates a focus on the task. Live demo [here](https://shakil-shahadat.github.io/onetask/).

Tasks are retained on refreshing or closing the tab.

Press `Ctrl + q` to set the task. Press `F11` to go full screen.
